<h3>Important Updates: v1.6 - v1.7</h3>
<p>On 11/21/2020, vocabulary.com decided to patch this bot. Their anti cheat system started to flag users with this script, so I added four things to make sure that doesn't happen.😈<br><br>Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Now waits a random interval between 2 to 4 seconds before answering question. Before it was a set interval of 2 seconds which would be flagged because it was constant. Not anymore 😉</li><br>
<li>Now doesn't open a random new list by switching url. (This was main reason users were getting flagged). It now uses a new function I wrote called <b>undetected_routing</b> which opens lists in a more secretive way. 😏</li><br>
<li>Now clicks buttons by simulating a real human mouse input, instead of just using the normal <b>.click()</b>. This is in case vocabulary.com is using event listeners to check if a user is actually submitting the words. 🖱</li><br>
<li>Now simulates keypresses on keyboard, in case vocabulary.com uses keypress listeners in their anti-cheat ⌨</li><br>
</ol>
